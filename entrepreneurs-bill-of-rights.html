                <h1>The Entrepreneur's Bill of Rights</h1>
                <p class="intro-text">Our promise to founders — written in plain language, not legalese.</p>

                    <p>We've been in your shoes. We've built and sold companies. We've also experienced situations where even the best-known VC firms violated basic ethics. That's why we drafted a guiding document for Rapscallion — a promise written in plain language, not legalese.</p>
                    
                    <p>We exist for the brave ones — the outlaws building what doesn't exist yet.</p>
                    
                    <p>You take the risk. You live the chaos. You earn the right to straight answers.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is our Bill of Rights — your guarantees when you deal with Rapscallion.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. The Right to Quick Decisions — or Honest Updates</h2>
                    
                    <p>You deserve clarity, and you'll get it. If we can make a decision quickly, we will. If we can't, we'll tell you why — and we'll communicate that status within a few weeks, even if the update is simply: we don't know yet.</p>
                    
                    <p>Silence is never acceptable.</p>
                    
                    <h2>2. The Right to Conflict Transparency</h2>
                    
                    <p>Trust starts with disclosure. If we've invested in, spoken with, or are considering investing in a potential competitor, you'll know that in our first conversation. If we're unsure, we'll err on the side of caution and warn you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your confidence in our integrity matters more than our deal flow.</p>
                    
                    <h2>3. The Right to Radical Honesty</h2>
                    
                    <p>We will always tell you the truth — especially when it's uncomfortable. If we decline to invest, we'll tell you kindly, directly, and with reasoning.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe straightforward feedback is far more respectful than polite silence.</p>
                    
                    <h2>4. The Right to Privacy</h2>
                    <p>It’s a “well-known secret” in venture that some people swap confidential company info. We don’t. Ever. Sharing founder materials without consent (on in cases where it is legally required) is a zero-tolerance, fireable offense at Rapscallion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your data, ideas, and materials are yours.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>5. The Right to Respect</h2>
                    
                    <p>You, the entrepreneur, are at the center of our culture. We exist to serve you, not the other way around. If you ever feel disrespected — by any partner, associate, or advisor — tell us. We will conduct an internal review and report back to you our findings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Respect isn't optional; it's structural.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Closing Note</h2>
                    
                    <p>This Bill of Rights is our covenant with founders. It's how we hold ourselves accountable — and how we hope to raise the standard of ethics in venture capital. Rapscallion was built to serve creators with courage and capital that honors their trust.</p>
