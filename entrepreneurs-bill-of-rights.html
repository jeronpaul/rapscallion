                    </div>
                    <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Rapscallion was built to serve creators with courage and capital that honors their trust. We've been in your shoes. We've built and sold companies. We've also experienced situations where even the best-known VC firms violated basic ethics. This Bill of Rights is our covenant with founders. It's how we hold ourselves accountable.</p>
                    
                    <p>We exist for the brave ones — the outlaws building what doesn't exist yet.</p>
                    
                    <p>You take the risk. You live the chaos. You earn the right to straight answers.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is our Bill of Rights — your guarantees when you deal with Rapscallion.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. The Right to Quick Decisions — or Honest Updates</h2>
                    
                    <p>You deserve clarity, and you'll get it. If we can make a decision quickly, we will. If we can't, we'll tell you why — and we'll communicate that status within a few weeks, even if the update is simply: we don't know yet.</p>
                    
                    <p>Silence is never acceptable.</p>
                    
                    <h2>2. The Right to Conflict Transparency</h2>
                    
                    <p>Trust starts with disclosure. If we've invested in, spoken with, or are considering investing in a potential competitor, you'll know that in our first conversation. If we're unsure, we'll err on the side of caution and warn you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your confidence in our integrity matters more than our deal flow.</p>
                    
                    <h2>3. The Right to Radical Honesty</h2>
                    
                    <p>We will always tell you the truth — especially when it's uncomfortable. If we decline to invest, we'll tell you kindly, directly, and with reasoning.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe straightforward feedback is far more respectful than polite silence.</p>
                    
                    <h2>4. The Right to Privacy</h2>
                    <p>It’s a “well-known secret” in venture that some people swap confidential company info. We don’t. Ever. Sharing founder materials without consent (on in cases where it is legally required) is a zero-tolerance, fireable offense at Rapscallion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your data, ideas, and materials are yours.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>5. The Right to Respect</h2>
                    
                    <p>You, the entrepreneur, are at the center of our culture. We exist to serve you, not the other way around. If you ever feel disrespected — by any partner, associate, or advisor — tell us. We will conduct an internal review and report back to you our findings.</p>
