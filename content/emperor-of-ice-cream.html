                            <p>"What is the difference between a villain and a super-villain? PRESENTATION!" – Megamind</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Megamind's line is funny because "presentation" feels like the least important thing. We usually assume what makes something "super" is its core function—the substance, not the surface. In startup terms, we assume the product is the most important thing, and the presentation is just a way to get people to try it. </p>

                        <p>But sometimes, the surface is the most important thing. If you can't get people to try your product, it doesn't matter how good it is. I'd argue that in the short-term marketing is more important than the product. In the long-term, it probably switches.</p>

                        <p>I love great literature. I remember reading kind of wild poem in High School that made this point. The poem is Wallace Stevens' <em>The Emperor of Ice Cream</em>. The setting is a funeral, and the poem gets pretty descriptve about the corpse on display. But the star of the poem isn't the deceased—it's a muscular, cigar-rolling man whipping up ice cream for the mourners.</p>

                        <p>Many interpret the poem as bleak: life is short, death is inevitable, and our pleasures are just distractions before we are all "eaten by worms". But there's another reading: the ice cream of life—those fleeting indulgences and moments of delight—isn't a distraction. It's the point.</p>

                        <p>That idea comes into sharp focus in the closing lines:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Let be be finale of seem.<br>
                            The only emperor is the emperor of ice cream."</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Here Stevens collapses the distinction between appearance and reality. In our analogy he collapses the distinction between marketing and product. What seems—marketing—is in some sense the product itself.</p>

                        <p>This is particularly true in the early days for startups. Most startups have a product that is not that great at first. Well maybe it's great but it's almost always an MVP and customers need and want much more. So you have to get your prospects and customers to buy into the vision of your product. It's an aspirational sale at this stage. You have to collapse your product and your marketing message.</p> 
                        
                        <p>The best way to do this sell more than just a product; you need to sell an "identity." This means you help customers to see that when they choose your product, they are actually saying something about themselves.</p>

                        <p>A productivity tool isn't just an app—it's a declaration: <em>I am efficient</em>.</p>

                        <p>A design platform isn't just software—it says: <em>I am creative</em>.</p>

                        <p>A financial automation system isn't just code—it signals: <em>I am trustworthy and in control</em>.</p>

                        <p>This is why presentation matters so deeply. People don't just buy products; they buy identities. They use your brand as a mirror for who they want to be.</p>

                        <p>And here's the startup twist: branding comes first. By definition, a prospect has to hear about you and resonate with your pitch before they ever try your product. And in the early days, your product will almost certainly be imperfect. You rely on the aspirational sale—you sell the story, the identity, the ice cream—long before the substance fully matures.</p>

                        <p>This isn't to say the product doesn't matter. It does. But without presentation, no one will stick around long enough to experience the substance.</p>

                        <p>So here's the challenge: take a marketing-first approach. Presentation isn't window dressing. It's what people live for.</p>

                        <p>And the lesson for founders is Megamind-simple: the difference might not be the tech or the features. It might just be—presentation.</p>
