                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>When people talk about Clayton Christensen, almost everyone remembers his theory of disruptive innovation. It reshaped how we think about markets, competition, and growth. But Christensen had another big idea—one that never got as much airtime. He argued that a company's culture should be understood not primarily as a list of values or internal rituals, but as a set of beliefs about how to solve the customer's problem.</p>

                    <p>That insight has always resonated with me. Culture isn't a vibe, or a poster in the break room, or even a carefully worded list of values. Culture is a living system of problem-solving behaviors, sustained over time. And it should be anchored in the problems customers trust us to solve.</p>

                    <p>At Spiff, this perspective became the foundation for how we thought about our own culture.</p>

                    <h2>Culture as a Problem-Solving System</h2>

                    <p>Most companies define culture as shared beliefs or values. That's not wrong—but it's incomplete. At Spiff we came to see culture as the relationship between three forces: our people, our customer problems, and our way of working.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-1.png" alt="Culture relates to the problem we solve together" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>This link to the customer's problem is what gives culture its true shape. When we framed it this way, the purpose of our culture became obvious: to create the optimal environment for solving our customers' hardest challenges.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-2.png" alt="Spiff's Culture / People / Customer Problems" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>This three-way relationship wasn't just theoretical—it was practical. Every decision we made about how to work together, from our hiring practices to our meeting structures, was evaluated against one question: "Does this help us solve our customers' problems better?"</p>

                    <h2>Why We Rejected "Core Values"</h2>

                    <p>We wrestled with the idea of core values. Many companies enshrine them in stone. But we found that approach too rigid. People bring their own values to work—and that diversity is what sparks creativity, authenticity, and psychological safety.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-3.png" alt="Would you prefer that Spiff have a set of core values?" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>Instead of prescribing values, we looked for repeated patterns of behavior that helped us solve customer problems. Actions mattered more than slogans. We discovered that the most effective teams weren't those with the most aligned values, but those with the most aligned behaviors around problem-solving.</p>

                    <p>This approach allowed for individual authenticity while maintaining collective effectiveness. People could bring their whole selves to work while still contributing to a shared mission of solving customer problems.</p>

                    <h2>From Core Values to Patterns</h2>

                    <p>That's how we arrived at Spiff Patterns. Patterns are stronger than hypotheses, but not as rigid as laws. They are repeatable behaviors that create trust with customers and progress for the company.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-4.png" alt="No Core Values → Core Values → Patterns" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>This evolution from rigid values to flexible patterns was crucial. We needed something that could guide behavior without constraining creativity. Patterns gave us that balance—they were specific enough to be actionable, but flexible enough to adapt to different situations and personalities.</p>

                    <p>We defined eight Spiff Patterns that shaped how we worked together:</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-5.png" alt="Spiff Patterns" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>We put customer trust first.</strong> Every decision was evaluated against its impact on customer trust. This wasn't just about being honest—it was about being reliable, transparent, and consistently delivering on our promises.</li>
                        <li><strong>We build masterpieces.</strong> We didn't just want to solve problems; we wanted to solve them beautifully. This meant taking pride in our work and going the extra mile to create something exceptional.</li>
                        <li><strong>We are prolific.</strong> Speed mattered, but not at the expense of quality. We aimed to be both fast and thorough, producing high-quality work consistently.</li>
                        <li><strong>We create an environment where the best ideas win.</strong> Hierarchy didn't determine whose ideas got heard. The best solution, regardless of who proposed it, was what we implemented.</li>
                        <li><strong>We seek diverse perspectives.</strong> We actively looked for different viewpoints and experiences, knowing that the best solutions often came from unexpected places.</li>
                        <li><strong>We are reflective learners.</strong> We regularly stepped back to analyze what was working and what wasn't, using those insights to improve our approach.</li>
                        <li><strong>We laugh along the way.</strong> Work should be enjoyable. We found that teams that could laugh together were more creative, more resilient, and more effective.</li>
                        <li><strong>We care as much about how we win as winning itself.</strong> The process mattered as much as the outcome. We wanted to succeed, but we wanted to succeed in a way that made us proud.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Each of these patterns ties directly back to the problem we solve for customers—automating the most complex financial processes with trust and transparency. They weren't abstract principles; they were practical behaviors that helped us deliver better solutions.</p>

                    <h2>Culture Has a Job to Do</h2>

                    <p>We treated culture as something practical, with a job description. Its role wasn't to decorate the company with feel-good language. Its role was to:</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-6.png" alt="Spiff's Culture Has a Job to Do" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inspire our best work.</strong> Culture should motivate people to bring their full capabilities to work every day, not just go through the motions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create an environment where information wasn't spun or suppressed.</strong> We needed honest communication to solve complex problems effectively. Culture had to make it safe to share bad news and difficult truths.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stand for something meaningful.</strong> People want to work for companies that stand for something beyond just making money. Our culture had to connect our daily work to a larger purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ensure work was intrinsically rewarding.</strong> The work itself had to be satisfying, not just the outcomes. Culture had to make the process of problem-solving enjoyable and fulfilling.</li>
                        <li><strong>And ultimately, help us build trustworthy products that solved real customer problems.</strong> Everything else was secondary to this core mission.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In other words, culture's job was to help us be better at our job. It wasn't about making people feel good—it was about making people more effective at solving customer problems.</p>

                    <h2>The Outcome</h2>

                    <p>The result was a culture less about internal self-congratulation and more about external service. It shaped how we hired, how we debated, how we built software, and even how we gave back to our communities through SpiffUp.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-7.png" alt="We focus our mission on our customers' problems" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>This customer-focused approach had tangible results. Our team became more aligned around shared goals, our decision-making became faster and more consistent, and our customer satisfaction scores improved significantly. But perhaps most importantly, it gave us something that felt uniquely ours: a culture not imposed from the top down, but discovered in the trenches of solving customer problems together.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-8.png" alt="Culture outcomes and impact" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>We found that when culture is rooted in customer problems, it becomes self-reinforcing. Every success in solving a customer problem validated our approach, making it easier to maintain the behaviors that led to that success. This created a positive feedback loop that strengthened our culture over time.</p>

                    <h2>A Hidden Christensen Legacy</h2>

                    <p>Looking back, I think Christensen's underappreciated insight deserves more recognition. Disruptive innovation taught us how industries evolve. But this other idea—culture as the collective memory of how to solve customer problems—teaches us how companies endure.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-9.png" alt="Christensen's two key insights" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>At Spiff, we didn't always get it perfect. But by rooting our culture in customer problems, we built something more lasting than slogans: a system that could flex, adapt, and scale, while always pointing toward the customer.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-10.png" alt="Culture as collective memory" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>This approach to culture as collective memory proved especially valuable during challenging times. When we faced difficult decisions or unexpected obstacles, we could always fall back on our shared understanding of how to solve customer problems. This provided both direction and stability.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-11.png" alt="Building lasting culture" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>And in today's world of fleeting trends and fragile morale, I think that's Christensen's most enduring lesson. While other companies chase the latest management fads or try to copy successful cultures, those that root their culture in customer problems create something that can't be easily replicated—because it's uniquely suited to their specific mission and market.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-12.png" alt="The enduring value of customer-focused culture" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>This isn't just about Spiff or even about startups. Any organization that wants to build a lasting culture should start with a simple question: "What problems do our customers trust us to solve?" Answer that question honestly, and you'll have the foundation for a culture that can guide your organization through good times and bad.</p>

                    <h2>Lessons for Other Organizations</h2>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-13.png" alt="Key lessons for building customer-focused culture" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p>Based on our experience at Spiff, here are the key principles we learned about building a culture rooted in customer problems:</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-14.png" alt="Practical implementation steps" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Start with the customer, not with values.</strong> Don't begin by asking "What do we believe?" Instead, ask "What problems do our customers face that we're uniquely positioned to solve?"</p>

                    <p><strong>Look for patterns, not prescriptions.</strong> Instead of imposing values from the top, identify the behaviors that actually help you solve customer problems better.</p>

                    <p><strong>Make culture practical, not aspirational.</strong> Every cultural element should have a clear connection to customer problem-solving. If you can't explain how it helps customers, question whether it belongs in your culture.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-15.png" alt="Measuring culture success" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Measure what matters.</strong> Track customer satisfaction, problem-solving effectiveness, and team alignment around customer goals. These are better indicators of cultural health than employee satisfaction surveys.</p>

                    <div class="article-image">
                        <img src="../images/culture-16.png" alt="The future of customer-focused culture" style="width: 100%; max-width: 624px; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Stay flexible, stay focused.</strong> As your understanding of customer problems evolves, your culture should evolve too. The goal isn't to create a perfect culture, but to create a culture that helps you get better at solving the problems that matter most to your customers.</p>

                    <p>In the end, culture isn't about making your company a great place to work—though that often happens as a byproduct. It's about making your company great at what it does. And what it does, fundamentally, is solve problems for customers.</p>
