                    <p>Music has always been a mirror of our times. As we navigate the AI revolution, certain tracks capture the essence of our digital transformationâ€”the excitement, the uncertainty, the raw energy of technological change.</p>

                    <p>This playlist explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, technology, and human creativity. From the electronic beats of Big Data to the atmospheric soundscapes of deadmau5, each track tells a story about our relationship with technology. Most of them end badly (sorry, haha) but somehow they are still fun. And I feel like the power of the creativity in the music is it's own powerful assertion of human force against the machine.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: The Veldt by Deadmau5 is based on the a short story by Ray Bradbury called "The Veldt" about the risks of technology and the dangers of automation.</p>

                    <p>Whether you're coding, building, or just contemplating the future, these songs provide the perfect soundtrack for the AI era.</p>
