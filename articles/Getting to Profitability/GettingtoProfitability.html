You can&rsquo;t really have one without the other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Every business decision you make has an ROI component associated with it. &nbsp;Should I hire a new account rep? &nbsp;Should I invest in a new automation system? &nbsp;Should I hire more developers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All of these questions are just variations of a bigger question: &nbsp;Will the money I make from this decision result in profit (i.e., have positive ROI)? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you hire a new account rep, the value he creates over time should offset his cost. &nbsp;The same goes for a dev. &nbsp;The value she creates should offset her cost as well. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So should you invest in every positive ROI opportunity you can find? &nbsp;For example, if you hire a sales rep and they give you a positive ROI, should you hire a dozen more to bolster your profit? Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t quite work that way. The major buzzkill on ROI is often timing. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s break this example down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Example: &nbsp;Hiring a New Sales Rep</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s say you hire a sales rep with a base salary of $3,000 / month and 15% commission on all sales. &nbsp;Now let&rsquo;s assume your sales rep doesn&rsquo;t have a successful close for 3 months but then begins to bring in $1,500 of new MRR (monthly recurring revenue) every month after the initial learning curve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The math looks like this: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[info_callout]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the example below, you&rsquo;ll see a few acronyms: </span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_tbq59qpbrq6s-0 start"><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">MRB</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;refers to monthly recurring burn, or the monthly cost of the rep &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Cumulative Cost</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is just the ongoing amount of MRB</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">New MRR</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;refers to new monthly recurring revenue (growth in MRR) &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Cumulative MRR</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;refers to the total balance of MRR (growth plus previous MRR)</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Cumulative Revenue</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;includes the portion of cumulative MRR that has been received to date.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[/info_callout]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 460.00px; height: 422.00px;"><img alt="SalespersonExample.png" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 460.00px; height: 422.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By month 6, the sales rep has achieved MRR that exceeds their MRB. &nbsp;So for each month after month 6, the sales rep is profitable on a monthly basis (see the yellow lines on the month 6 row above). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, the sales rep has cost you a cumulative total of $19,350 by the end of month 6 and has only brought in cumulative revenue of $9,000. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this rate, the rep won&rsquo;t achieve a cumulative profitability until month 10 when they&rsquo;ve repaid your investment and continue to be profitable (see the yellow lines on the month 10 row above).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This scenario is a mini example of profitability as a whole. Whether we&rsquo;re talking about an entire company or one single rep, there are &nbsp;always two profitability points for companies with MRR: &nbsp;a monthly profitability point and a cumulative profitability point. &nbsp;When cumulative profitability has been achieved, it also means the payback period has been reached.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>[cta_callout]</span><span class="c5">Payback period</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;refers to the amount of time it takes for an investment to recuperate its own cost.[/cta_callout]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The payback period of the rep is 10 months, but what about the rep&rsquo;s ROI? &nbsp;For that we have to look at the total cost of the rep over the total return. &nbsp;We could get really complicated here but we&rsquo;ll keep it simple. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s say your average rep costs an average of $150K per year and creates $400K of annually recurring revenue in a year. &nbsp;Since the revenue is recurring it might be worth something like 5x its annually recurring annualized value, or $2M. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So a simplistic ROI would be:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c7">($2M - $150K) / $150K = 1567%</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that seems insanely high to you, you&rsquo;re spot on. &nbsp;To keep the scenario simple, we ignored the full cost of acquiring, onboarding, and supporting customers, and the time value of money. We also assumed that the only business cost of the sales rep&rsquo;s revenue is his or her salary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A truer ROI calculation would be much more complex and significantly lower... but still high (I&rsquo;d hope).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">ROI, Cash Balance, and Payback Period</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The answer to my previously asked question about ROI opportunities should be clear at this point. Although in theory you should greenlight every positive ROI opportunity that comes a-knockin&rsquo;, factors like time and money will force you to slow down or break. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reality is that a sales rep like the one mentioned above will hit your bank account by approximately $20K before recuperating cost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you had $100K in the bank, then in theory you could afford to hire 5 new sales reps. Number 6 would be the tipping point that would send you headfirst into bankruptcy, missed payroll, or some other kind of dire cash crunch. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are other scenarios, as well, such as a poor performing rep that could push the breakeven point farther back or possibly indefinitely. For this reason, it&rsquo;s wise not to stretch your budget to the limit, hiring 2-3 sales reps instead of 5 with a budget of $100k.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So looking at positive ROI investments isn&rsquo;t the only thing you need to consider when getting to profitability. &nbsp;You have to look at how much you have in your bank account and whether or not you can afford the investments you are considering. &nbsp;Also, you need to look at the risk the investment won&rsquo;t pan out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>When you are in a really tight cash crunch, ROI be might less of a good thing in comparison to say, the </span><span class="c5">payback period</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>During our most severe cash crunch at Capshare, we were totally confident that we had ~30</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;immediate and incredibly high-ROI</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;investment opportunities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>But our conundrum was that we didn&rsquo;t want to raise more money (i.e., we wanted to get to profitability over a short-term period), so we took the ~30 investment opportunities and sorted those by </span><span class="c2">payback period.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We only greenlighted investments where we were convinced we could get a payback within 1-2 quarters max so we could get to profitability faster.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.xlp400f2lzh8"><span class="c13">#5 Grow Like a Weed</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I know I said this article wasn&rsquo;t about how to grow revenue, but I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention the interesting problem we had at Capshare regarding growth. Our business was growing at over 100% per year, but because we wanted to get to profitability ASAP, we couldn&rsquo;t invest much money to support it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In a nutshell, our problem was this: how do we grow really fast without increasing cost?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We ended up almost tripling our client base while decreasing our headcount by 2 people over a period of 2 years, and it was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever done in my business career. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know that I can recommend it for you in good conscience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But some amazing things happened when our back was against the wall. &nbsp;It reminded me of the Aeschylus quote from John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s funeral service:</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c0">&quot;He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.&quot; &nbsp;--Aeschylus</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Dramatic, I know. But I really cannot find more precise words to describe what it was like for us during this period. But through the pain and sleepless nights, and the hours, days, weeks, and months, grinding on the profitability / growth problem, we found strength and an incredible scrappiness that allowed for the growth we needed without the investment we couldn&rsquo;t afford.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We called our methods &ldquo;weed strategies.&rdquo; &nbsp;Weeds can grow anywhere in the hardest of conditions and are nearly impossible to kill. We could certainly relate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yes, we worked crazy long hours, but we also ended up finding several low-cost (or almost no-cost) strategies to continue to grow. &nbsp;We called these opportunities &ldquo;infinite ROI investments.&rdquo; &nbsp;With enough time, patience, and pain tolerance, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Is it really possible to find infinite ROI investments? &nbsp;In my opinion, you can get pretty darn close. &nbsp;Here are few examples from our experience:</span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_qkwmk9c85ogo-0 start"><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We hired a sales rep with effectively no base salary but a very large commission</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We cross-trained our head of chat support to take on some additional sales work</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We cross-trained another sales rep to add several channel selling opportunities</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We found that at our lead volume and with our sales commission schedule, simply hiring another sales rep had almost no cost because it temporarily decreased the higher commission tiers most of our other sales reps were hitting</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Generally increasing capacity utilization of any of your assets is a huge area for no-or-low-cost productivity gains</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Implement an RSPP. &nbsp;This definitely has cost but its &ldquo;cash&rdquo; cost is zero since it substitutes equity for cash. &nbsp;Ultimately our team viewed this as a big positive not a sacrifice.</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Ask several people to take pay cuts</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I should also mention that if you&rsquo;re going to succeed, you need to have a solid team behind you. For Capshare&rsquo;s part, we had a heroic team that, because of their dedication, I now consider part of my &ldquo;band of brothers.&rdquo; If you have a team like that, you can weather the worst of it. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.8udwi350hz0"><span class="c13">Maintain Ongoing Discipline</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve mentioned above that getting Capshare to profitability was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve done in my career, and it required an inhuman amount of discipline. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you want to get to profitability, you&rsquo;re going to need &nbsp;&ldquo;Medieval ascetic monk&rdquo; discipline. &nbsp;Every time you think about spending money you should whip yourself. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I mention this because it&rsquo;s hard to overemphasize how enticing (maybe even addictive) spending money in pursuit of growing your business is. &nbsp;Afterall, you started your business because of your immovable belief in its enormous potential. So what&rsquo;s a few bucks compared to the inevitable payoff?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The thing is, you may not ever reach that payoff if you spend your way into bankruptcy. Scores of potential investments or spending opportunities will present themselves weekly, like sirens calling you to shipwreck. If your goal is profitability, you&rsquo;re going to have to get good at saying &ldquo;no,&rdquo; at least until you can raise money again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>One of the biggest insights I gained is that startup failure is totally within your control. &nbsp;As long as you can stand the pain of hard work with little or no salary, your startup will continue to survive. &nbsp;And as Paul Graham has said, the best advice for startup success is &ldquo;</span><span class="c9"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756504787416483&amp;usg=AOvVaw185DEUs61du_vxqVPBrRvG">Don&rsquo;t Die</a></span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.ui6fhm37t6f3"><span class="c13">Raising Your Series P</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll end with a new concept for most entrepreneurs seeking venture funding. &nbsp;What if you could raise capital every day without giving up any equity in your company? &nbsp;What if that funding source just got bigger and bigger every day? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It turns out, you can. &nbsp;I call it &ldquo;raising your Series P&rdquo; &nbsp;with the P representing profitability. &nbsp;While there are tradeoffs you should consider, including growth and the overwhelming desire to bang your head against the nearest wall, raising your Series P could end up being much more worthwhile than spending 12 months trying to raise a Series A, B, or C at a ridiculous valuation. In fact, we believe the percentage of successful startups would be much higher if new companies focused more on profitability. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Being on the other side of the grind, we at Capshare can say that there&rsquo;s nothing quite like hiring new employees knowing that our monthly profits covers their cost. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We want you to achieve profitability to, so we&rsquo;ve created a profitability checklist:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[cta_callout]Download our profitability checklist here to make sure you have turned over every stone in your quest to raise your Series P.[/cta_callout]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Thanks to </span><span class="c9"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariana-crisafulli-6392ba106/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756504787418578&amp;usg=AOvVaw1IGuDxOr0UcwaWLO0A7s3K">Ariana Crisafulli</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c9"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewbstapleton/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756504787418682&amp;usg=AOvVaw1SscfA8cKqOiezRuKyiOem">Matt Stapleton</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;who were both major contributors to this article.</span></p></body></html>
