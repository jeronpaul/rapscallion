                        <h3>Be Honest</h3>
                        <p>Acknowledge your motives and express thoughts without faking it. Deep honesty prompts others to respond the same way, creating real communication.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Be Kind</h3>
                        <p>Kindness builds trust more effectively than other practices. It's not weak or naive—it's an emotional language everyone understands.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Presume Good Will</h3>
                        <p>Don't assume critics are stupid or have evil intentions. Grant that others are clear-thinking and good-hearted unless proven otherwise.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Listen Well</h3>
                        <p>Focus intensely on the person speaking, not on your response. True listening is about understanding, not waiting to speak.</p>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Share the Floor</h3>
                        <p>Allow others equal time to speak, even when you "know" you're right. This acknowledges mutual dignity in conversation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Acknowledge Differences</h3>
                        <p>Each person has unique history and perspective. Openly acknowledging differences creates trust for real conversation.</p>

                        <h3>Answer Tough Questions</h3>
                        <p>Address difficult questions straightforwardly. This builds strong mutual trust and allows facing offensive issues without taking offense.</p>

                        <h3>Give Credit Where Due</h3>
                        <p>Sincere compliments from unexpected sources can powerfully move hearts toward trust. Admire excellence on "the other side."</p>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Speak Only for Yourself</h3>
                        <p>Don't stereotype others or claim to know what they believe. Ask, don't tell. Speak only for yourself unless authorized otherwise.</p>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Keep Private Things Private</h3>
                        <p>Respect personal dignity by honoring someone's choice to share privately. Being open doesn't require disclosing everything to everyone.</p>

                <h2>Building Trust Through Openness</h2>
                <p>The Way of Openness transforms how we engage with difficult conversations. It's not just about talking—it's about truly connecting, building trust, and finding common ground where it seems impossible.</p>
                <p>At Rapscallion, we believe these principles are essential for meaningful dialogue in business, investment, and life.</p>
